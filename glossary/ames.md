**Ames** is the name of the Urbit network and the [vane](../vane) that communicates over it. It's an encrypted peer-to-peer network composed of instances of the [Arvo](../arvo) operating system. Each [galaxy](../galaxy), [star](../star), [planet](../planet), [moon](../moon), and [comet](../comet) communicates over the network utilizing the Ames protocol.

Your ship upgrades itself with [OTA updates](../ota-updates) via communication over Ames. The web interface, [Landscape](../landscape), of ships can be accessed by typing `sampel-palnet.arvo.network` into a browser, where `sampel-palnet` is the name of your ship.
